# :DROPOUT Quality of Life

Tired of the volume resetting and captions turning off every episode? I made a script to fix it. Install TamperMonkey or your favorite script extension to experience simple quality of life.

## Features
- Volume Persistence. (Volume stays the same as last episode.)

- Captions Persistence. (Captions stay on!)

- A 'Next Episode' button next to the Captions button.

### Installing

#### Step 1: Install a Userscript Manager

You need a userscript manager such as:

- TamperMonkey

- GreaseMonkey

#### Step 2: Get the Script

Just click [here](https://github.com/oh-ari/DropoutFix/blob/main/dropout.user.js), or for instant installation, the raw page is below and at least with TamperMonkey, this will prompt it to more or less automatically add it for you.

[dropout.user.js](https://github.com/oh-ari/DropoutFix/raw/refs/heads/main/dropout.user.js)

#### Step 3: Install the Script

1. Open your userscript manager dashboard.

2. Click + to create a new script.

3. Paste the copied script.

4. Save the script.

#### Step 4: Enjoy!
